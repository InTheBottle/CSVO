This list is meant to modded, adding and patching mods is fairly simple and I will assume you have some decent knowledge on that part already. I will provide the LOD settings used, a long with the ParallaxGen conflict load order below.
These will help you when you add new meshes or overhauls etc and have to rerun these things for yourself.

    !!! warning
        As long as you want lods and PBR, you'll generally need to rerun each of these when you add new meshes or location overhauls.
