# Post-Installation

There are a few things you can and should do. 

1. Run Bethini through the MO2 dropdown and select a preset + recommended tweaks. (Do not turn of TAA, required if you use CS' DLAA or AMDs.)
2. The CSVO separator will probably say "1.2" I made an oopsie and forgot to remove the versioning, it's wrong you are on the latest version if you updated. (I will fix this I just didn't want to push another update for that yet)
3. Read the basic instructions on modifying the list below with LOD and PGPatcher settings.

## Antivirus Exceptions
- Add exceptions in Windows Defender for the CSVO folder and `ModOrganizer.exe` to avoid crashes.
- Steps: Windows Security > Virus & Threat Protection > Manage Settings > Exclusions > Add Folder > Select CSVO folder.

## Keyboard Keybinds
- **Community Shaders**: `End` key.
- Other controls use vanilla Skyrim keybinds.

## Playing the Game
- Launch Skyrim SE through Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) in the CSVO folder.
- Enjoy the enhanced visuals!
